Supervised Machine Learning - Predicting Credit Risk

## Objectives

The Purpose of this assignment is to build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not. To accomplish this task, we will be comparing a Logistic Regression model with a Random Forest Classifier model.

## Coonsider the models

We will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before we create, fit, and score the models, we will make a prediction as to which model we think will perform better.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
